1. App concept: a website for writers to meet and find Critique Parnters for their works and to offer their own critiques.   


2. Technologies used
    React
    CSS
    Netlify



3. Approach Taken
    This was built to be a full CRUD application, with the ability for users to post their works and view others. 
    The base surrounds the Home component, which shows all posts (mapped through the data pulled in from the backend server). The additional components include Show, and a form which is meant to function for both Create and Update apps. 
    Users can delete posts. 


4. Link to site:

https://priceless-dijkstra-8d10c6.netlify.app/home

5. Unsolved problem:

Edit and Create routes. 

6. Future goals:

-implement auth
-implement dates and times for posts
-filter by genre
-extensive css
-postings for sensitivity readers
